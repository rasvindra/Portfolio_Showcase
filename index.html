            <h2>Personal Biography</h2>
            <p>I was born in India. I lived there for 5 years and then moved to the PNW when my father remarried to my amazingly strong, independant, and compassionate mother. As a first generation immigrant I tried to soak up all that the Pacific Northwest has to offer. I enjoy camping, skiing, hiking and in general being able to absorb the peace and serenity of nature in our beautiful corner of the world. I am blessed to have been married to my wife Lisa for ten years. I have two step children in college, and my daughter in elementary school, who is the light of my life. My main background is in healthcare, specifically in Optometry. However, I am excited to transition to Web Development, and to share my ability and growth as a developer through this showcase.</p>
